# Python training
This is an introduction to Python basic commands, modules and concepts that are required for working in the development environment.

### Python basics:
 - If you are new to python and object oriented programing (OOP) 
     - Read the [following tutorial](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) and do these exercises:
        - control statements (1 ex)
        - collections (all ex)
        - loops (1 ex)
        - errors (1 ex)
        - functions (1 ex)
        - classes (all ex) 
    - It is recommended to download and use pycharm or jupyter notebook for these assignments as these are the common ways for working with python.
    - Skip the chapters about GUI ans algorithms.
 - If you are familiar with OOP but not with python - read the [following tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/). 
 - If you are familiar with python - make sure you are familiar with the commands used [here](https://github.com/gumption/Python_for_Data_Science/blob/master/3_Python_Basic_Concepts.ipynb).
 
  ### Numpy:
  - Do the first 50 exercises in [100 numpy exercises](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100).
  - Focus on understanding whats possible with numpy and less on remembering function names\syntax.
  
  ### OOP + Clean code
   - Read briefly or skim through the following chapters in the "Clean Code" book (in Sources): 
        - Chapter 1 - Clean code (introduction, read or skim)
        - Chapter 2 - Names (read)
        - Chapter 3 - Functions (read) 
        - Chapter 4 - Comments (skim)
        - Chapter 5 - Formatting (skim)
        - Chapter 6 - Objects and data structures (read)
        - Chapter 7 - Error handling (read up to p.106, not-including "Use Unchecked Exceptions" section)
        - Chapter 9 - Unit tests (read only bottom line - F.I.R.S.T principles, p. 132)
        - Chapter 10 - Classes (read)
        - Chapter 16 - Refactoring SerialDate (skim)
        - Chapter 17 - Smells and Heuristics (high level summary, read or skim)
   - Answer the questions in the dry part file.
   - Build a paint-like application using OOP:
        - Read the problem definition in the final exercise file.
        - It is recommended to design your architecture before programing it and discuss it with your instructor.

### Pandas
 - Read briefly [Introduction in 10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html).
 - Do at least one exercise in [pandas exercise](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises) feel free to do more if needed.
 - Work in jupyter notebook for this part.

### Data visualization
 - Your goal in this exercise is to communicate and present findings in a visual and comprehensible way.
 - The data you will work on is the titanic passengers data, you can find it titanic.xls file.
 - The table columns are as follows:
    - passengerID
    - Survived - did the passenger survived
    - Pclass - passenger class
    - Name
    - Sex
    - Age
    - Sibsp - number of siblings and/or spouse on board
    - Parch - number of parents/children on board
    - Fare - ticket fare
    - Cabin - room number
    - Embarked - the port the passenger embarked from
- Plot graphs that depict:
    - How is age distributed in every pclass and in every age?
    -  Which family had lost the most members?
    - Is there a connection between the age of a passenger and it's chance of survival? What about his pclass?
    - What is the relation between survivors to deceased in every pclass?
- IMPORTANT: Present more findings with meaningful insights, as you see fit.
- For plotting graphs, read about matplotlib and seaborn and work with these modules.

### Final exam
- Read and do the final Exam "Azrieli and Sons".
- This exercise emphesizes working in a "real-life" situation, i.e with a real-life costumer and data.
- One of your team members will pose as mr./mrs. Azrieli, and should act as a costumer only. It is prefeble that you will talk with him as you would talk with usual costumers in your work enviroment (probably e-mail).
- Aside from the notebook you will do you main work on, write a document that describes the problems you found in the data, the solutions for the problems and the reasoning behind them.
