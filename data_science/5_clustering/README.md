### Clustering
#### Theory
 - Read about K-means and Agglomerative clustering from 
    Data Mining (in books) pages 443-469 chapter 10-10.3 (not including 3.3)
 - Read about cluster evaluation chapter 10.6 pages 483-491
 - Read about the DBSCAN algorithm , Data Mining (in books) pages 471-479 (10.4)
#### Exercise
 - Apply semantic segmentation on the star image, try to separate it from background.
 - Implement two clustering methods:
    - K-means - in vectorized form.
    - Agglomerative clustering - you might encounter issues in your implementation, you will need to find a feasible solution and implement it
  - For each method use the next features:
     - Color
     - Color and pixel distance
